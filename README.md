## Thermostate

### :mag: What?

Thermostate is a simple / fun tool that predicts the sentiment (positive/negative) of given text.

### :question: Why

Thermostate is a side project I started to learn and enjoy. The goal was to test out multiple technologies i've never used before in one and fun project.

### :wrench: How

The main parts of the stack are as follows:

-   `Svelte`: the framework of choice
-   `Ml5.js`: machine learning framework to predict the sentiment of the text.
-   `Anime.js`: Animation library used to move things in a flashy way :rainbow:
